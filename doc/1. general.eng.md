## 1.6 Lua Script in Four Directions ##

## 1.6.1 Introduction ##

Lua script could be given in 4 directions:

1. direction 0 (**dir0**): from client to cache server on http request


2. direction 1 (**dir1**): from cache server to origin server on http request


3. direction 2 (**dir2**): from origin server to cache server on http response


4. direction 3 (**dir3**): from cache server to client on http response

### 1.6.2 Set By Lua Block - bgn\_set\_by\_lua\_block ###
**Directives**

Syntax :    bgn\_set\_by\_lua\_block {dir0|0|dir1|1|dir2|2|dir3|3|dir4|4} $res { lua-script };

Context:    main, server, location

Phase:    Content

Use of this directive is discouraged due to it is hard to control the spawned coroutine switching and output to client.

This directive is designed to execute short, fast running code blocks as the Nginx event loop is blocked during code execution. Time consuming code sequences should therefore be avoided.

Any Lua APIs requiring yielding the current Lua "light thread" cannot work in this directive.

At least the following API functions are currently disabled within the context of set_by_lua:

    Output API functions (e.g., ngx.say and ngx.send_headers)
    Control API functions (e.g., ngx.exit)
    Subrequest API functions (e.g., ngx.location.capture and ngx.location.capture_multi)
    Cosocket API functions (e.g., ngx.socket.tcp and ngx.req.socket).
    Sleeping API function ngx.sleep.

### 1.6.3 Set By Lua File - bgn\_set\_by\_lua\_file ###
**Directives**

Syntax :    bgn\_set\_by\_lua\_file {dir0|0|dir1|1|dir2|2|dir3|3|dir4|4} $res <path-to-lua-script-file>;

Context:    main, server, location

Phase:    Content

Use of this directive is discouraged due to it is hard to control the spawned coroutine switching and output to client.

Equivalent to bgn\_set\_by\_lua, except that the file specified by <path-to-lua-script-file> contains the Lua code, or, the Lua/LuaJIT bytecode to be executed.

Nginx variable interpolation is supported in the <path-to-lua-script-file> argument string of this directive. But special care must be taken for injection attacks.

When a relative path like foo/bar.lua is given, they will be turned into the absolute path relative to the server prefix path determined by the -p PATH command-line option while starting the Nginx server.

When the Lua code cache is turned on (by default), the user code is loaded once at the first request and cached and the Nginx config must be reloaded each time the Lua source file is modified. The Lua code cache can be temporarily disabled during development by switching lua_code_cache off in nginx.conf to avoid reloading Nginx.

### 1.6.4 Run Lua Block - bgn\_lua\_block ###
**Directives**

Syntax :    bgn\_lua\_block {dir0|0|dir1|1|dir2|2|dir3|3|dir4|4} { lua-script };

Context:    main, server, location

Phase:    Content

Use of this directive is discouraged due to it is hard to control the spawned coroutine switching and output to client.

Acts as a part of a "content handler" of bgn module, and executes Lua code string specified in <lua-script-str> for every request. The Lua code may make API calls and is executed as a new spawned coroutine in an independent global environment (i.e. a sandbox).

### 1.6.5 Run Lua File - bgn\_lua\_file ###
**Directives**

Syntax :    bgn\_lua\_file {dir0|0|dir1|1|dir2|2|dir3|3|dir4|4} rel/or/abs/path/to/script;

Context:    main, server, location

Phase:    Content

Use of this directive is discouraged due to it is hard to control the spawned coroutine switching and output to client.

Equivalent to bgn\_lua\_block, except that the file specified by <path-to-lua-script-file> contains the Lua code, or, the Lua/LuaJIT bytecode to be executed.

Nginx variables can be used in the <path-to-lua-script-file> string to provide flexibility. This however carries some risks and is not ordinarily recommended.

When a relative path like foo/bar.lua is given, they will be turned into the absolute path relative to the server prefix path determined by the -p PATH command-line option while starting the Nginx server.

When the Lua code cache is turned on (by default), the user code is loaded once at the first request and cached and the Nginx config must be reloaded each time the Lua source file is modified. The Lua code cache can be temporarily disabled during development by switching lua_code_cache off in nginx.conf to avoid reloading Nginx.

## 1.7 Upstream ##

### 1.7.1 upstream\_by\_bgn ###

**Directives**

Syntax :    upstream\_by\_bgn {URL};

Context:    main, server, location, if in location, limit_except

Phase:    Content

Description: 

Sets the protocol and address of a proxied server to which a location should be mapped. As a protocol, “http” or “https” can be specified. The address can be specified as a domain name or IP address, and an optional port:

    upstream_by_bgn http://localhost:8080;

If a domain name resolves to several addresses, only the first one will be used.

Parameter value can contain variables. In this case, if an address is specified as a domain name, the name is searched among the described server groups, and, if not found, is determined using a resolver.

The request URI would be ignored and domain or ipv4 and port works only.

When location is specified using a regular expression, and also inside named locations.
In these cases, upstream\_by\_bgn should be specified without a URI.

Also this directive supports typically dyups:
    upstream backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080  weight=1 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
        server 127.0.0.1:8090  weight=5 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
        keepalive 1000;
        keepalive_timeout 300s;
    }
    location ~ /demo {
        upstream_by_bgn http://backend;
        content_by_bgn cvendor;
    }
